# _Udacity_ Data Analyst Nanodegree

#### _by jbelenag_

In this repository I will upload the exercises I will be doing during the [_Data Analyst Nanodegree_](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002#) provided by [_Udacity_](https://www.udacity.com/)

The source data is directly downloaded from the course.


### Project 0: Bay Area Bike Share [_(dand-p0-babs)_](https://github.com/jbelenag/dand-uc/tree/master/dand-p0-babs)

We will work with real data provided by Bay Area Bike Share to determine differences in usage between commuters and tourists ridership patterns, average duration of trips, and much more!
